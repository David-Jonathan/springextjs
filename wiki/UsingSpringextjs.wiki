How to use springextjs

= Introduction =

The goal of this project is to easily integrate Spring3 with ExtJS remoting specification.
I have tried to make it as simple as possible but I a msure there is much room for improvement.

Polling remoting has not been completely worked out but will be is coming weeks.


= Setting Up Controller=

This is as simple as extending a the base abstract controller

{{{
public class MyRemotingController extends BaseExtJsRemotingController{
...
}
}}}
